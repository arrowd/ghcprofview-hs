Description: GHC .prof files viewer, implemented in Haskell + Gtk3.
  .
  Unlike profiterole and profiteur, ghcprofview uses a traditional approach to
  profiling. It allows you to view cost centres tree as it is and browse it
  interactively, and allows you to do some actions that you may be used to in,
  for example, Java's visualvm.
